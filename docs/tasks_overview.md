# Tasks Overview

- Implement CIFAR-100 data pipeline and preprocessing.
- Define baseline and custom CNN architectures (ResNet18, VGG16, custom variants).
- Integrate TenSEAL-based selective encryption for federated client updates.
- Prototype Yin, Random, and Confusion attack strategies.
- Establish federated learning simulation harness with configurable rounds and clients.
- Evaluate image reconstruction metrics (PSNR, SSIM) and model performance under attacks.
- Produce experiment notebooks, aggregate reports, and final documentation.
